This repository created as a part of assignment of coursera IBM Applied data science capston course to get certification and practise the data wrangling 
and data collection through API and webscraping by BeautifulSoup library.

In capstone, we will predict if the Falcon 9 first stage will land successfully. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars; other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, 
much of the savings is because SpaceX can reuse the first stage. 

## Objectives:

In this lab, we will make a get request to the SpaceX API and do some basic data wrangling and formating.

1.Request to the SpaceX API

2.Clean the requested data

3.Extract a Falcon 9 launch records HTML table from Wikipedia

4.Parse the table and convert it into a Pandas data frame
